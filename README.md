# !1010!

## Background

!1010! is an easy-to-learn and highly addictive puzzle game that's inspired by *1010!*. The game is similar to Tetris, but unique in that you can manipulate the Tetris-style blocks at your own pace. The rules are simple: (1) Combine puzzle blocks in order to build and destroy full lines vertically and horizontally and (2) Don't let the puzzle blocks fill up the grid.
